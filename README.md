# Text-To-Speech
This project focuses on creating a basic text-to-speech application using Python. The application provides a user interface built with the Tkinter GUI library for accepting user inputs and playing speech outputs. The Pyttsx3 library is used to convert the user's text input into speech.

The project involves creating an application window with a label for prompting the user to enter text, a text entry field for input, and buttons for playing the speech output, resetting the input field, and exiting the program.

The application uses Pyttsx3's text-to-speech engine to generate audio output from the user's input. The engine analyzes the input text using basic natural language processing techniques, such as identifying individual words and their meanings. Pyttsx3 also uses some basic speech recognition capabilities to produce an accurate audio output.

The project demonstrates the basic principles and applications of natural language processing and speech recognition in a practical context. It also shows how easy it is to integrate these technologies into Python applications using Pyttsx3. The final product is a simple and practical example of a text-to-speech application that can be used for a variety of purpose.
